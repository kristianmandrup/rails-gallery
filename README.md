# Photo Gallery components for Rails

Popular Javascript Photo galleries/carousels ready to use with Rails 3+.

## Usage

`gem 'rails-gallery'`

## Galleries included

* slideshow (v ???)
* responsive (v ???)
* galleria (v1.4.2)
* touch_touch (v ???)

Please add more using a similar convention as is used for these galleries ;)

## Configuration

In `application.css` manifest file:

```css
/*
 *= require gallery/responsive/elastislide
 *= require gallery/responsive
 *= require gallery/slideshow
 *= require gallery/galleria/classic
 *= require gallery/touch_touch
*/
```

Using Compass, f.ex in `application.css.scss`

```
@import 'gallery/responsive/elastislide';
@import 'gallery/responsive';
@import 'gallery/slideshow';
@import 'gallery/galleria/classic';
@import 'gallery/touch_touch';
```

In `application.js` manifest file:

```javascript
//= require gallery/responsive
//= require gallery/slideshow
//= require gallery/galleria
//= require gallery/galleria/classic
//= require gallery/touch_touch

//= require jquery/jquery.easing-1.3
//= require jquery/jquery.elastislide
//= require jquery/jquery.tmpl.min
```

Note: For galleria, you need to specify the theme to use.

## Touch-Touch

```javascript
$(function(){

    // Initialize the gallery
    $('#thumbs a').touchTouch();

});
```

See [TouchTouch](http://tutorialzine.com/2012/04/mobile-touch-gallery/) and [github repo](https://github.com/martinaglv/touchTouch)

```haml
= touchgal_image photo
```

See [minimalistic-slideshow-gallery](http://tympanus.net/codrops/2010/07/05/minimalistic-slideshow-gallery/) for more info.


### Customization

Pls Fill in here ;)

## Responsive gallery

See [responsive-image-gallery](http://tympanus.net/codrops/2011/09/20/responsive-image-gallery/) for more info.

### Customization

*Remove thumbnails*

Change `mode = 'carousel'` to `'fullview'`

*Remove 'mode' bar*

```css
.rg-view{
  display: none;
}

.rg-thumbs {
  padding-top: 10px;
}
```

*placement of thumbnails*

To adjust placement of thumbnails, use: `prependTo` or `appendTo` in `gallery/responsive.js`:

```javascript
  _addImageWrapper= function() {
    
    // adds the structure for the large image and the navigation buttons (if total items > 1)
    // also initializes the navigation events
    $('#img-wrapper-tmpl').tmpl( {itemsCount : itemsCount} ).prependTo( $rgGallery )
```

*Automatic slideshow*

I wanted the same thing and I find a way to do it.
In the file gallery.js, in the function `_initCarousel` add these lines after: 

`$esCarousel.elastislide( 'setCurrent', current );`

```javascript
window.setInterval(function(){
  _navigate( 'right' );
}, 5000);
```

You just have to change `5000` to the value you want (milliseconds).

* Fancybox integration*

First you have to include the js and the css file of fancybox in the file where you have the carousel.

In the file `responsive.js`, replace this line: 

`$rgGallery.find('div.rg-image').empty().append('img src="' + largesrc + '"');` 

With this (which adds 'fancybox' class to all images):

`$rgGallery.find('div.rg-image').empty().append('a class="fancybox"
href="'+largesrc+ '" img src="' + largesrc + '" a');`

In this line, don’t forget to add the `"` for the img and link tags.

Then do the fancybox magic on any class with the `fancybox` class 

```javascript
$(document).ready(function() {
  $(“.fancybox”).fancybox();
});
```

## Galleria

See [galleria.io](http://galleria.io) for more info.

[quick start](http://galleria.io/docs/getting_started/quick_start/)

```css
#galleria { 
  width: 700px; 
  height: 400px; 
  background: white 
}
```

Important: You need to specify the width and height of the galleria container object in your CSS (here the `#galleria` DOM node). Otherwise you will get a trace error!

```javascript
Galleria.loadTheme('gallery/galleria/classic.js');

// or simply
Galleria.loadNamedTheme('classic');

// or for asset path
Galleria.loadAssetTheme('classic');

// Then configure
Galleria.configure({
    imageCrop: true,
    transition: 'fade',
    log: true,
    // better handle image paths in assets folder!
    assets: true,
    // if pic can't be loaded use this one as fallback
    dummy: '/assets/photos/dummy.png' 
});  

Galleria.run('#galleria');
```

*Troubleshooting a javascript gallery*

Many of the Javascript galleries don't play very well with Rails and the asset pipeline as they expect a pretty simple application file structure/setup.

As an example, in order to make *galleria* work, I had to add a `normalizeSrc` method, which ensures that it looks for an image of the form `/assets/...` when configured with `assets: true` (See `Galleria.configure` options).

You might well encounter similar troubles. Another potential problem is browser caching, where you might well have to add a timestamp to the image url. Something like:

`my/image.png?235325325323232`

In some cases you might wanna hide the image tags and only execute/initialize the gallery when the images have finished loading, fx via the `imagesLoaded` jQuery plugin. Good luck!

### Model Configuration

The engine comes with a RGallery::Photos` model which can encapsulate your photos for display and allows you to group photos in multiple pages.
The `RGallery::Photo` class is a base class for describing a photo. 

You should create your own Photo class that inherits from `RGallery::Photo` (or implements the API), which knows how to render and describe your photos.

Here is a rough example:

```ruby
class Property
  class Photo < RGallery::Photo
    def initialize property, options = {}
      super
    end
    alias_method :property, :obj

    def path
      File.join folder, super
    end

    # mogrify -path fullpathto/temp2 -resize 60x60% -quality 60 -format jpg *.png

    # this will take all png files in your current directory (temp), 
    # resize to 60% (of largest dimension and keep aspect ratio), 
    # set jpg quality to 60 and convert to jpg.
    def thumb
      File.join folder, 'thumbs', file_path
    end

    def folder
      'gallery/images'
    end

    # Here we expect to create each photo with the 
    # id being set to a Property object
    def property
      id
    end

    # The filename of the picture. 
    # Here it assumes that the id assigned is a Property object, which has a 
    # method 'picture' which returns the picture id.
    def filename
      "property-#{property.picture}"
    end    

    def title
      property.title
    end

    def alt
      title
    end
    
    def self.extension
      :jpg
    end
  end
end
```

See the `lib/rails-gallery/rgallery/photos.rb` for details on how to extend this class appropriately to fit your scenario.

*debugging*

In order to help debug the configuration of the photo class, you can use the view_helper methods:

```ruby
= validate_gallery_photo photo # prints error msg if invalid
- validate_gallery_photo! photo # raise error if invalid
```

Or you can include the `RailsGallery::PhotoValidation` module anywhere you want to leverage these methods!


## Rails engine usage

The `RailsGallery::ViewHelper` is inluded into ActionView::Base by the engine.

The following are the main methods exposed:

* gallery_image type, photo
* gallery_imageset type, photo

Example usage:

```haml
= gallery_image :responsive, photo`
= gallery_imageset :galleria, photo`
```

The photo argument must be a kind of `RGallery::Photo::

### Controller and partials

Some *HAML* views (partials) are included in `app/views/gallery`

### Rails views usage

First set up photos in your controller.

```ruby
class PropertiesController < ApplicationController
  def show
    @property = property
  end

  protected

  def property
    Hashie::Mash.new  title: 'A beautiful property', 
                      description: decription,
                      photos: photos
  end

  def description
    %q{Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Praesent mauris arcu, auctor ac rhoncus non,  libero. Nulla dolor velit, volutpat a bibendum ut, hendrerit id mi. Pellentesque convallis erat in mi interdum rutrum. Phasellus interdum velit nulla.
    }
  end  

  def photos
    @photos ||= RGallery::Photos.new nil, photo_class: Property::Photo
    5.times do |n|
      # using a paginator to get a page of properties
      @photos.pages << Property.page(n)
    end
    @photos
  end
end
```

In `property/show.html.haml`, render one of the partials of this gem, sending it the list of photos as a local variable `photo`:

```haml
.gallery
  = render partial: 'gallery/gallery', locals: { photos: @property.photos}
```

*Responsive Gallery*

In your `properties/show.html.haml`:

```haml
= render partial: 'gallery/template/responsive'
= render partial: 'gallery/responsive', locals: { photos: @property.photos }
```

Note :Currently only the *responsive* gallery uses a template, and thus requires rendering an extra partial.

*Slideshow Gallery*

```haml
= render partial: 'gallery/slideshow', locals: { photos: @property.photos }
```

*Galleria*

```haml
= render partial: 'gallery/galleria', locals: { photos: @property.photos }
```

All galleries should follow this convention (or as close as possible)

## Labels

Note that all gallery labels are rendered using Rails I18n `I18n.t`.
You should include appropriate translations for the following keys under 'rgallery':

* previous
* next
* photos_loading

The engine includes a `config/locales/rails_gallery.yml` file, currently only with english translation mappings. Include a `config/locales/rails_gallery.yml` file in your Rails app and override or supply you additional translation mappings ;)

## View helpers

There are some view helpers included in `rails-gallery/view_helper.rb`

`= gallery_image type, photo`

*Simple example:*

Iterate all photos as a "single page".

```haml
- photos.all.each do |photo|
  = gallery_image :responsive, photo`
```

*Pages example:*

Iterate photos, one page at a time.

```haml
- photos.pages.each do |photo|
  = gallery_image :responsive, photo`
```

*Advanced example:*

Iterate photos, first page visible, then remaining pages invisible.

```haml
.page.visible
  - photos.page(:first).photos.each do |photo|
    = gallery_image :responsive, photo`

- photos.pages.remainder.each do |page|
  .page.hidden
    - page.photos.each do |photo|
      = gallery_image :responsive, photo`
```

## Responsive gallery support

The RGallery also supports multiple photo sources for responsive galleries:

```ruby
@photos.pages.add_photo_w_sources 'banner' => [{src: 'banner-HD', sizing: '2x'}, {src: 'banner-phone', sizing: '100w'}]

Note: See module `RGallery::Pages` class.

# OR

@photos.pages.add_photo_sources 'banner' => [{src: 'banner-HD', sizing: '2x'}], 'logo' => [{src: 'logo-HD', sizing: '2x'}

# OR on individual pages

@photos.page(:first).add_photo_sources 'banner' => [{src: 'banner-HD', sizing: '2x'}], 'logo' => [{src: 'logo-HD', sizing: '2x'}

```

### Shortcuts for view helpers

```haml
# galleria
= riagal_image photo
= riagal_imageset photo

# slideshow
= slidegal_image photo
= slidegal_imageset photo

# responsive
= respgal_image photo
= respgal_imageset photo

# touchtouch
= touchgal_image photo
= touchgal_imageset photo
```

## Responsive images via "image srcset"

The View Helpers includes tag helpers to create image tags with [srcset](https://github.com/borismus/srcset-polyfill). This can be installed and used with [picturefill-rails](https://github.com/kristianmandrup/picturefill-rails)

Example:

```haml
- photos.pages.each do |photo|
  = gallery_imageset :responsive, photo`
```

Enjoy!

## Adding more galleries

Simply follow the existing conventions (see the code).

*ViewHelpers*

 Add the gallery name to the `#galleries` class method of the `ViewHelper` and create a module for that gallery with a `[name]_gallery_image(photo)` method.

Then add gallery client-side pieces to the assets folder following conventions and make sure that your css files (and possible js files) references the icons used (and any other asset) correctly  using `/assets/` in the path ;)

## TODO

Would be nice to allow pages/albums to have info assigned, such as title and/or description, tags etc.
